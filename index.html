          <p>To desire wisdom is to seek principles that cut through the superficial and trivial facts that clutter our intellectual landscape, revealing the shape of things underneath. Rather than get locked into the particulars, in order to overstand this, it is crucial that the operating principles (mo) are realized and the dominant patterns (intelligible sequences) are read.</p>
              <p>Table of (dis)contents: a) moving away from Black music as mainly connected to orality or an exaggerated admiration of the voice b) dislike of 
        focus on historical and biographical; instead focus more on parahistorical, ahistorical, analogical, anonymity and mythopoesis/fabulism c) 
        ignorance of electronics d) over-evaluation of Hip-Hop (James Baldwin: the slightest shift in Negro identity, the stars would lose position) 
        e) More emphasis on “unblack,” “unpopular,” and “unculture” and less on this idea of ghetto centricity to give more shine on unknown black 
              composers.</p>
              <p>You must recognize that consciousness is power; being aware, knowing something, and being able to do something is what consciousness is all about. This grants power. Remember, we act in terms of what we know, what we believe, what we expect, what we value, what skills we have. All of this is part of consciousness. Therefore, when you manipulate these things, you manipulate people’s ability.
              </p>
              <p>So ultimately, your salvation lies in power; not in the goodwill of the other people, not in the love of the other people, not in laws on the books. It ultimately must rest on pure power and the ability to stop other people from doing harmful things to you. Anything else is not adequate</p>
              <p>Civil rights is not the same as liberation, independence, and control of one’s self.
              It’s about life, and surviving, and overthrowing, and being liberated as a people.</p>
              <p>An answer brings no illumination unless the question has matured to a point where it gives rise to this answer which thus becomes its fruit. 
        Therefore learn how to put a question.

              <p>Travelling at the speed of thought: album or song titles are like theories condensed into a single statement to be unpacked later.</p>
              <p>We are unlimited spirits that have been restricted by the man made laws and beliefs (of the illusion). Words are used to shape ideas, identities, concepts, actions, and roles for you to follow.

        The first detachment is from the idea that you are your body. you are a spirit first. Think from your spirit. Use your body to enjoy this dimension. We are born into a controlled storyline that we unfortunately see as the natural way of life. The real self has no label. Create your own story; go deeper within and fulfil your souls mission!</p>
