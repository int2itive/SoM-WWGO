          <p>Cut the crap.</p>
          <p>Literally, cut the unnecessary distractions out of your life—delete apps, unfriend and unfollow toxic people, stop committing to activities you don’t care about. </p>
          <p>Trust people to be themselves, based on their incentives and what they've rationalized.</p>
          <p>You cannot have a healthyrelationship with a person who has an appetite for dominance. You cannot be friends with people who require to dominate you, because, while friendships are supposed to be mutual reciprocating energy. With people who want to dominate you, they're looking to absorb you. In order for them to even feel comfortable with themselves, not great, bit even just comfortable with themselves, they have to feel like they are bigger than the next person. You, are gonna be the next person. You are their friend; which means they do not have good intentions for you. You do not want to take advice from a person who does not have good intentions. You do not want to vent to them either. You have to validate their false reality by living in it, and adopting it as your own. If in their head they're dominant, you have to display that they're dominant, which means you must act small.</p>
          <p>Primer: an elementary textbook that serves as an introduction to a subject of study or is used for teaching children to read.</p>
          <p>To desire wisdom is to seek principles that cut through the superficial and trivial facts that clutter our intellectual landscape, revealing the shape of things underneath. Rather than get locked into the particulars, in order to overstand this, it is crucial tat the operating principles (mo) are realized and the dominant patterns (intelligible sequences) are read.</p>
              <p>Table of (dis)contents: a) moving away from Black music as mainly connected to orality or an exaggerated admiration of the voice b) dislike of 
        focus on historical and biographical; instead focus more on parahistorical, ahistorical, analogical, anonymity and mythopoesis/fabulism c) 
        ignorance of electronics d) over-evaluation of Hip-Hop (James Baldwin: the slightest shift in Negro identity, the stars would lose position) 
        e) More emphasis on “unblack,” “unpopular,” and “unculture” and less on this idea of ghetto centricity to give more shine on unknown black 
              composers.</p>
              <p>You must recognize that consciousness is power; being aware, knowing something, and being able to do something is what consciousness is all about. This grants power. Remember, we act in terms of what we know, what we believe, what we expect, what we value, what skills we have. All of this is part of consciousness. Therefore, when you manipulate these things, you manipulate people’s ability.
              </p>
              <p>So ultimately, your salvation lies in power; not in the goodwill of the other people, not in the love of the other people, not in laws on the books. It ultimately must rest on pure power and the ability to stop other people from doing harmful things to you. Anything else is not adequate</p>
              <p>Civil rights is not the same as liberation, independence, and control of one’s self.
              It’s about life, and surviving, and overthrowing, and being liberated as a people.</p>
              <p>An answer brings no illumination unless the question has matured to a point where it gives rise to this answer which thus becomes its fruit. 
        Therefore learn how to put a question.

              <p>Travelling at the speed of thought: album or song titles are like theories condensed into a single statement to be unpacked later.</p>
              <p>We are unlimited spirits that have been restricted by the man made laws and beliefs (of the illusion). Words are used to shape ideas, identities, concepts, actions, and roles for you to follow.

        The first detachment is from the idea that you are your body. you are a spirit first. Think from your spirit. Use your body to enjoy this dimension. We are born into a controlled storyline that we unfortunately see as the natural way of life. The real self has no label. Create your own story; go deeper within and fulfil your souls mission!</p>
              <p>There’s absolutely no reason to be-come upset over the n-word. You didn’t create the word; and yet, you do create the sound. That sound has been misappropriated, and then played back to you with an amplified, derogatory emphasis - compressed into what might be regarded as its meaning.</p>
              <p>The <strong>primary</strong> function of language is to practice and relay information. It serves as a tool to develop the mind and higher consciousness to work in unity with nature to maximise potential development.</p>
              <p>The <strong>secondary</strong> function of language is to communicate thoughts, feelings and ideas.</p>
              <p>The <strong>third</strong> function of language deals with administration of laws and commerce.</p>
              <p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>
              <p>Why do I want to do x? is pretty much the most important question you can ask before doing anything, but especially things that will cost you or someone else money, time, and energy.
The important part of asking "why" is being honest with yourself. (<strong>eg. making x amount of money; a headcount goal, that you made it happen at all</strong>.)</p>
              <p>Be honest here. Either way, at the end of all this work, you're going to be left with some very concrete realities.</p>
              <p>Being honest about "what will make the project a success for you" (also) allows people to make a decision about whether or not they should deal with you. Your motivation can be selfish or stupid, or greedy, but it should at least be honest. You're eventually going to reveal yourself in one way or another; Might as well save everyone the trouble and be forthcoming about your motivations.</p>
